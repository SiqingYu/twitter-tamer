# Distraction Free Twitter - a Chrome extension

A Chrome extension to make Twitter more distraction-free, [available in the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-distraction-remov/aflapchiclhldkgbbahbdionenmhkoed).

When the extension is first installed, nothing is selected, so nothing is hidden. Open the "options" page and choose the elements you'd like to hide, such as:

- Navigation bar items _(like "Notifications" or "Messages")_
- Activity on tweets by others _(like comments, faves, and likes)_
- Some media _(like images)_
- Sidebars _(like "Trends", "Live Video", "Who to Follow", etc)_
- Elements of others' timelines _(including their profile, photos/videos, etc)_
- ... and more

If you have a question or problem, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/distraction-free-twitter-chrome-extension/issues). Comments, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GrantWinney).
